              "\"\\nDescriptive statistics focus on describing the visible characteristics of a dataset (a population or sample).\\n\\nMeanwhile, inferential statistics focus on making predictions or generalizations about a larger dataset, based on a sample of those data.\\n\\nSure! Here's a short example of descriptive and inferential statistics:\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n1. Descriptive Statistics:\\nSuppose a teacher wants to understand the performance of her students in a math test. She records the scores (out of 100) of 30 students. \\nThe descriptive statistics in this case would involve calculating the mean, median, \\nand standard deviation of the test scores to understand the central tendency and variability of the performance. \\nFor example:\\n- Mean score: 75\\n- Median score: 78\\n- Standard deviation: 10\\n\\n2. Inferential Statistics:\\nContinuing with the same example, the teacher may want to make inferences about the entire class's performance based on the sample of 30 students. \\nTo do this, she could calculate a confidence interval for the average test score or conduct a hypothesis test to see if the class's average score is significantly different from a national average. \\nSuppose the teacher calculates a 95% confidence interval for the class's average score (mean ± 2 standard errors) as 70 to 80. \\nThis interval helps her infer that she is 95% confident that the average score of the whole class lies between 70 and 80.\\n\\nIn this example, \\ndescriptive statistics summarize the performance of the 30 students in the math test, \\nwhile inferential statistics allow the teacher to draw conclusions and make predictions about the entire class's performance based on the sample data.\\n\""
